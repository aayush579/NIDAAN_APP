# 🏙️ NIDAAN — Civic Issue Reporting System

NIDAAN is a **mobile-based civic issue reporting application** built using **Flutter (Dart)** that enables citizens to report, track, and resolve public infrastructure issues such as potholes, garbage overflow, water leakage, and streetlight failures.

The application is designed to **bridge the communication gap between citizens and local authorities** by providing a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly reporting platform.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In many cities, civic issues suffer from:
- Manual complaint processes
- Lack of transparency in issue resolution
- Poor communication between citizens and authorities
- No real-time tracking or accountability

As a result, complaints are often delayed, ignored, or duplicated.

## 💡 Solution Overview

NIDAAN provides a **digital-first solution** that allows users to:
- Report civic issues with location and images
- Track the status of reported complaints
- Receive updates on issue resolution
- Improve accountability and response efficiency

The system is designed to be **scalable, user-centric, and easy to integrate** with government or municipal backends.
